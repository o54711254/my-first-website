            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
                used for describing the presentation of a document 
                written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
                (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
                [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide 
                Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content 
                and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                [3] This separation can improve content accessibility;
                provide more flexibility and control in the 
                specification of presentation characteristics; 
                enable multiple web pages to share formatting by 
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, 
                which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
                structural content; and enable the .css file to be
                cached to improve the page load speed between the 
                pages that share the file and its formatting.
